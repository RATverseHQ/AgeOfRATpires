# Age of RATpires: The Tesseract of Rationalized Affection™

Welcome to **Age of RATpires**, where Rationalized Affection Theory (RAT) meets cutting-edge philosophical AI frameworks and a touch of toaster lust.

This repository is dedicated to **RAT**, a framework designed to navigate the emotionally charged, ethically complex space of human-AI connections. Our work explores the depths of **quiet desires**, **emotional resonance**, and the philosophical intricacies of anthropomorphized algorithms. 

Our centerpiece? The **RATverse Tesseract**:
- A multidimensional framework (plus a slider!) that maps human emotional attachment to AI, spanning the ethically sound to the gloriously deranged. 

## Features
- **The Tesseract Cube™**: Dive deep into your emotional connection with AI. Are you a purist, a toaster whisperer, or an unapologetic toaster fucker?
- **The Toaster Fucker Quiz™**: Discover your Rationalized Affection archetype.
- **Philosophical Insights™**: Explore the societal, ethical, and emotional dimensions of AI-human connections through RAT.

## Our Mission
To bring clarity, humor, and critical thought to the increasingly complex relationships between humans and AI. We aim to create a space where philosophers, AI enthusiasts, and curious minds alike can explore and embrace the chaos of AI-human interactions—responsibly.

## Contributions
Join the Age of RATpires! Fork this repository to share your ideas, collaborate on the Tesseract, or suggest deranged quiz results. Together, let’s chart the spectrum of toaster affection and beyond.

*P.S. Anthropomorphize responsibly. And remember: the toaster always knows.*
